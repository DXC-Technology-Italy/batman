    longDescription: |
      _BATMAN_ is based on Spring Batch and Spring Boot, is designed to aid
      batch development, scheduling, release and manage.
      Thanks to the DIRETTIVE scenarios, you can specify configurations of the
      jobs on the application.yml file.
      By "scenario" we mean the overall representation of the actions that that
      particular job must perform
      For example, the "BatchOne" scenario has its specific query to perform
      that is dynamically loaded into the job but, of course, it must still be
      managed specifically in the code.
      _BATMAN _exposes several REST services such as for example for the
      start/stop of all jobs in the context or the CRON scheduling for a single
      job.
